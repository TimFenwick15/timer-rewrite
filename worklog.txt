Proposal
rewrite timer to single unified gud version
- help including some popover graphic?
- use local storage to persist options across sessions?
- unit tests
- use that millis thing instead of setTimeout()
- ui re-design?
- desktop notifications api


Testable Note
Half right about timer: need to mock function dependencies - functions do need
to call each other sometimes

Timer code was wrong because
- ui buttons were mapped to js functions. Better way would be to have buttons
  start processes made of chains of pure functions
  Pure functions < interface
- functions called other functions
- vars were manipulated in a global way instead of passing through args
- my use of document was hard to mock? Make an object with this.document =
  document?

To fix, make functions more pure
Run sequences in dedicated places
Put dom interaction in its own file for easier mocking

A message system is good for testable code

Settings add combinatorial exlosion of test cases, use with caution

Dependency injection, inversion of control


Experiments
- Desktop notifivations work when tab not active (not in Chrome from file:///)
- css transformY good button annimation. Doesn't displace other page elements
- localStorage:
    > localStorage.setItem("timtmp", 3)
    < undefined
    > localStorage['timtmp']
    < "3"
    > localStorage.timtmp
    < "3"
  recommended to use Web Storage API (setItem, getItem, removeItem, key, length)
- will try a service worker on gh-pages - see if I can install timer on
  homescreen
- try push notifications
- MVC structure. Try

to do
- look at timer code - can I avoid using setInterval for my timing?
  - should be fine as is
- read testable js article
- plan functions / structure. Think testability
- @media for resizing
- maybe transpile
- maybe make a beep sound again
- maybe time in inputs roll over
